`SFIArtificialStockMarket.jl` is a [Julia package](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/) that implements the Sante Fe Institute Artificial Stock Market by Arthur et al.:

[Arthur, W. Brian, John H. Holland, Blake LeBaron, Richard G. Palmer, and Paul Tayler. "Asset pricing under endogenous expectations in an artificial stock market." Available at SSRN 2252 (1996).](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2252)

[LeBaron, Blake, W. Brian Arthur, and Richard Palmer. "Time series properties of an artificial stock market." Journal of Economic Dynamics and control 23, no. 9 (1999): 1487-1516.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165188998000815)

`SFIArtificialStockMarket.jl` derived its model architecture from the above reference papers and three other sources; namely, the [original source code](https://github.com/andrew-christianson/sfi-asm-mirror), [Detailed Notes on the Santa Fe Artificial Stock Market (ASM) Model](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/SFISTOCKDetailed.LT.htm), and the reference textbook:
